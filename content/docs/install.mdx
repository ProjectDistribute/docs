Distribute Project requires two 2 components to function: the DistributeApp (client) and Distributor (server).

## Step 1. Installing DistributeApp

To download the DistributeApp, visit the [official GitHub releases](https://github.com/ProjectDistribute/app/releases). Choose the version that corresponds to your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android). That's the easy part.

## Step 2. Connecting DistributeApp to Distributor

<Callout type="info" title="Server Setup Required">
  Don't have a server link? You need to set up Distributor first. Follow the instructions in Step 3 below to install Distributor on your server.
</Callout>

1. Open DistributeApp on your device.
2. Go to the Settings tab.
3. Enter the address that is used to access Distributor (e.g., `https://distributor.example.com`). If you used the script installer, you will see it displayed at the end of the installation.
4. Log in using your credentials (cry about it if you don't have em, cause this is a beta and you literally can't create users yet).


## Step 3. Installing Distributor

Distributor is the server component that works alongside DistributeApp to manage and sync your music files. It's currently only available for Linux (x86, arm64). To install Distributor, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- A Linux server
- Electricity ⚡️

### Option 1: Using the Installer Script
1. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ProjectDistribute/distributor/main/install.sh | bash
   ```
2. Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

### Option 2: Manual Installation
1. Download [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) if you haven't already.
2. Create a directory for Distributor:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/distributor
    cd ~/distributor
    ```
3. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:
    ```bash
    nano docker-compose.yml
    ```
4. Add the following configuration to the `docker-compose.yml` file:
    ```yaml
    services:
      distributor:
        build: .
        ports:
          - "8585:8585"
        volumes:
          - ./data:/app/data
        image: distributor
        environment:
          # Requst mails settings
          - MAIL_CATEGORIES=cd,digital

          # Listening address
          - LISTEN_ON=0.0.0.0:8585

          # Customization
          - REQUEST_MAIL_ANNOUNCEMENT=test

          # Set this if you want to enable admin features. 
          # NOTE: If you change the username, previous admin user will remain admin.
          - ADMIN_USERNAME=sourcelocation
    ```

5. Start Distributor using Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```


6. (Unimplemented) Set up a reverse proxy with HTTPS using Nginx and Let's Encrypt for secure access. (Nginx Proxy Manager is recommended)

  
7. (Unimplemented) Access Distributor by navigating to `https://your-server-ip:8585` in your web browser.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed DistributeApp and Distributor. You can now start syncing and managing your music files across your devices.
